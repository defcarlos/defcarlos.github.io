            <h1>The harassment of ideology</h1>
            <p class="subheading">An attempt to use non-philosophy</p>
        </hgroup>
        <div id="entry">
            <p>I don’t want to pretend that I understand non-philosophy. However, there is something that’s mentioned within that 
                context that feels understandable to me - ideologies harass us. These harassing ideologies form the logic of how 
                we see the world. Often ideologies are baked into us from an early age. We are told this is how the world works, 
                this is how a person is to think, act, and feel. The result is that we internalize the ideology.</p>
            <p>Take the belief that the government is by the people and for the people. The government doesn’t let us be. It requires 
                us to be citizens, tax payers, lawful, patriotic, insert any idea handed down to us from our governments. Some might 
                feel like they enact these roles freely, but (I think) non-philosophy would argue we are being forced to enact these 
                roles. Moreover, the government has a preconceived citizen and forces us to take on that shape. The uniqueness of the 
                individual isn’t respected. We have to force ourselves to fit the role of the citizen that is demanded by the 
                government. To do otherwise opens us up to punishment ranging from being made a pariah, paying fines, to incarceration 
                and even death. I outline this example because I want to show how consequential systems of thought are. They aren’t 
                simply floating around in our heads, they have an impact on the world.</p>
            <p>How about a more local example of how ideologies impact our lives - our identity. Let’s take the question, what does it 
                mean to be a man? The question itself presupposes an answer exists. Like a call and response in a ritual. Certainly we 
                can reply by saying, someone with an xy chromosome is a man. Typically, this question is asking us what a man is in our 
                social context and how the role is acted out. Your answer informs your reaction to all sorts of stimuli. Your answer 
                might be something like a man independent, a provider, tough, commands respect, etc. This is one of those harassing systems 
                of thought. The reality is that the question presupposed a certain system of thought with its own internal logic. It 
                forces us to be actors, instead of ourselves.</p>
            <p>The unfortunate reality is that we cannot exit ideology completely. We simply leave one ideology for another ideology. 
                The hope is that we can see how much we are harassed by the current ideology we find ourselves in and we exit it for 
                an ideology that’s freer. What might that sort of ideology look like? Instead of asking itself what shape the human 
                can be forced into, it can ask what is the human and what shapes does the human want to be in. If that ideology doesn’t exist 
                we have to create it with our co-conspirators in the pursuit of a freer world.</p>
