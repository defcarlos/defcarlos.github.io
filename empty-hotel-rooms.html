            <p>I recently had the good fortune of going on a family trip that included my parents. While this might sound 
                like a nightmare for some, it was something we never got to do while i was growing up so we didn’t really 
                know what to expect. Fortunate also, because my parents are decent people and easy going. As it turned out, 
                it was a pleasant trip. Since the future is uncertain I’m glad we were able to do it at least once.</p>
            <p>As chance has it, the hotel gave us rooms next door to each other. My parents left a day earlier than my 
                family and I did. The night before they left, we paid them a visit and wished them a good flight. The next 
                day whenever I walked past their hotel door I thought of it as <em>their hotel room</em>. It all felt poignant.</p>
            <p>It all got me thinking, isn’t that what life is like? You’re in a hotel with this or that friend, relative, 
                significant other. But everyone has different checkout dates. One moment the people 
                in our lives are there and the next their hotel room is empty and it’s like they were never there. Your trip 
                is a little longer than theirs so you carry on. But you’re left missing them. The reality is that the longer 
                your travels, the more vacancies you can expect.</p>
