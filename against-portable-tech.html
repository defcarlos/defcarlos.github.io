                In <em>I and Thou</em>, Martin Buber asks readers to consider the quality of their interactions with their fellow humans. 
                Are they having I-thou experiences or I-it? Another way to frame this is as his posthumous translator, Walter Kaufmann, 
                phrases it - are our interactions with people treating them as means to an end or as ends in themselves? I very much 
                doubt Buber could have imagined the social wasteland that awaited future society. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Let’s consider some grim statistics from <a href="https://www.consumeraffairs.com/cell_phones/cell-phone-statistics.html#usage-and-habits">Consumer Affairs</a>. 
            </p>
            <div>
                <blockquote>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Nearly 57% of Americans consider themselves "mobile phone addicts."</li>
                        <li>Three in four admit to feeling uncomfortable without their phones.</li>
                        <li>On average, cell phone users look at their phones <strong>144 times a day.</strong></li>
                        <li>Per day, Americans spend an average of <strong>4 hours and 30 minutes</strong> on their phones, up 52% from 2022, when they used 
                            their phones daily for 2 hours and 54 minutes. This is expected to increase to <strong>4 hours and 39 minutes</strong> this year.</li>
                        <li>The most common phone activities are checking email, taking photos and surfing the internet.</li>

            <p>Anecdotally, I recently passed by a cafe one night and saw nearly everyone in there on some kind of portable device. 
                There are a plethora of opinion pieces and research articles discussing the negative impacts of our constant use of 
                technology. With Buber on my mind I am particularly interested in the impact portable technology is having on our 
                socialization. We are eschewing interactions with our fellow humans to scroll endlessly through what usually amounts 
                to intellectual trash. The best you might do while scrolling is read the news to which I shall direct your attention 
                to what Mr Kaufmann has to say.</p>
            <div>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Mundus vult decipi: the world wants to be deceived. The truth is too complex and frightening; the taste for the 
                        truth is an acquired taste that few acquire.</p>
                    <p>Not all deceptions are palatable. Untruths are too easy to come by, too quickly exploded, too cheap and ephemeral 
                        to give lasting comfort. Mundus vult decipi; but there is a hierarchy of deceptions.</p>
                    <p>Near the bottom of the ladder is journalism: a steady stream of irresponsible distortions that most people find 
                        refreshing although on the morning after, or at least within a week, it will be stale and flat.</p>

            <p>I am not better than the next person. I too, all too often, succumb to the siren call of my cell phone. I can’t 
                remember the last time I left the house without one. I also almost always leave home with a book. No one has asked 
                me about the book I’m reading, but I’d like to believe approaching a stranger for chit-chat is easier to do with a 
                book as an opening topic than a cell phone that is acting like a shield against socializing.</p>
            <p>This is my call to arms. Holster your phone and open yourself up to your fellow human. The internet can wait until 
                you get home. That text message isn’t usually urgent. That meme won’t disappear and if does you won’t be the worse 
                for having missed it. Your fellow human has a limited shelf life. If you put a little effort into the encounter you 
                might have a genuine encounter where you see the person as a thou and not as an it.</p>
