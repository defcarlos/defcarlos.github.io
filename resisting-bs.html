            <p>It’s important for us to maintain a healthy skepticism when ingesting the explanations we are being given by those 
                in charge. Half truths, misinformation, lies, and bullshit are constantly shaping our view of the world. At the 
                macro-level, we can see this in the form of the perception management used by the US government 
                (see this <a href="https://theintercept.com/2023/05/17/pentagon-perception-management-office/">Intercept article</a> on the topic).</p>
            <p>On a smaller level let's look at an example of something that might set off your bullshit meter - return to office. 
                Since the lifting of lockdown restrictions a consistent flow of corporations have rolled back hybrid or fully 
                remote work schedules and are demanding workers return to the office full-time. These include things like, 
                improved company culture, informal conversations that can lead to innovations, dynamic problem solving, 
                mentorship, and networking (see this HRD Connect article). The reality is these are only excuses for forcing this 
                change without seeming draconian to the outside world. To anyone that finds themselves working in an office, the 
                reasons are plainly false. Teams had increasingly become distributed, especially in large multinational corporations. 
                You may find yourself never having in-person interactions with people you work with regularly. For anyone with even 
                the slightest sense of incredulity it is clear workers are being recalled because those in charge have felt a slip in 
                their control over their employees. Return to office is a move towards reestablishing control by forcing workers to 
                be in a particular location for a particular amount of time. While in the privacy of their homes workers were able to 
                do all sorts of productive things when there was not much work for them to do - cook, clean, read, rest, spend time 
                with family and friends. In the office these workers are now forced to pretend to be busy or even seek out more work 
                because everyone else seems to be busy and they don’t want the negative attention that comes with being seen as not 
                busy. </p>
            <p>What is to be done? Unfortunately, I can only come up with what feels like a facile plan of resistance. We must 
                work towards fine tuning our independent judgement. What I am asking all of us to do is engage in an intellectual 
                form of anarchist calisthenics. Like physical calisthenics, you should start small. Ask yourself does this line of 
                argument make sense? What am I being asked to believe? Apply some disbelief and question. Our ability to apply independent 
                judgement, critical thinking, and logic have atrophied from lack of use. This is no fault of our own. The conditioning 
                required to blindley take orders and follow arbitrary rules is from a lifetime of conditioning. From childhood into 
                adulthood our environment has foreclosed certain options by having rules and laws against them, and by applying social 
                pressure to conform. Like physical anarchist calisthenics, the intellectual variety will prepare us for the day when 
                we are told to believe something truly horrible.</p>
