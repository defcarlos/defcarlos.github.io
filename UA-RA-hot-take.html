            <p class="subheading">Hard lessons are being learned about allying with the US</p>
        </hgroup>
        <div id=entry>
            <p>For a long time it has been an open secret (at least state site) that the Ukrainian-Russian war was really a 
                NATO-Russian war occurring in Ukraine using the Ukrainian military. And if we are more honest, NATO is a proxy 
                for the US.</p>
            <p>Since taking office Trump has been extremely eager to end the Ukraine-Russia conflict. To the horror of Ukraine 
                and other European Allies Trump has gone forward with initializing talks without them. Let’s not even get into 
                the concessions that Trump has made from the very beginning of these talks. Isn’t it strange that talks are 
                happening with the US and Russia about a conflict between Ukraine and Russia? Talks that when finalized, 
                Ukraine will be forced to accept. It’s all being talked about so matter of factly, it’s almost easy to miss the 
                absurdity of the whole thing. The talks reveal that this has always been a US-Russian conflict with the 
                unfortunate people of Ukraine paying the hefty price.</p>
            <p>Another thing on display is an increasingly common pattern. If you are allied with the US, expect to get burned. 
                In the past we have seen this pattern with weaker states, from South Vietnam to the more recent sloppy withdrawal 
                from Afghanistan. We are now seeing it repeat itself in Europe. It’s hard to know what US-European relationships 
                will look like after this. According to the Bureau of Industry and Security’s 
                <a href="https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/documents/technology-evaluation/ote-data-portal/3015-2021-statistical-analysis-of-u-s-trade-with-european-union-countries/file" target="_blank">
                    “The US Trade with the European Union, 2021 (PDF, opens in a new window)”</a>,</p>
                <blockquote>
                    In 2021, of the $491.3 billion in U.S. imports from European Union, the top commodity sectors were Chemicals, 
                    Plastics, Rubber, and Leather products (31.5%), Machinery and Mechanical Appliances (20.4%), and Transportation 
                    Equipment (11.3%).
                </blockquote>
            <p>While bringing the conflict to a quick end early in his Presidency may win Trump some immediate political points 
                at home, it’s hard to imagine this working out in the long run for the working class in our globally connected 
                world.</p>
