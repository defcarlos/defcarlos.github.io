                When the Democratic Socialist of America (DSA) canceled a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/14/us/adolph-reed-controversy.html">talk</a> they scheduled with Adolph Reed back in 2020, I became 
                aware of the term class reductionism and I’m sure many others did too. At its simplest, the term means that a person 
                explains all social ills through class and all other concerns and struggles - sexism, racism, LGBTQ+, etc. should be 
                ignored because they will be improved once class issues are addressed. Implisit in the term is the suggestion that a 
                class reductionist is bigoted or doesn’t care about the struggles faced by particular identity groups.
            </p>
            <p>
                Adolph Reed and DSA affiliated magazine, Jacobin, have argued that <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/live/MDO6x6u9PlI?si=KHZDz2g218c82tUN">there is no such thing as class reductionism</a>. 
                Like with many such arguments, people on either side are firmly entrenched in their views and aren’t likely to change 
                their minds. I am sympathetic to Adolph Reed and others of his ilk. As far as I understand their argument, they are 
                trying to address the disunity they observe on the left and rally around a theme that cuts across all identities. When 
                the key organizational component is identity and concerns specific to that identity, it’s hard to create the mass 
                movement they believe is required for substantive change. They point to many of the rights won during the early part of 
                the 20th century through organizing the working class. I can also understand the identitarian side of things. To engage 
                in class struggle and secure the rights pointed to these identitarian groups’ concerns have had to take a backseat.

                Tensions are made worse when such a heterogeneous group hangs all of its specific hopes and dreams on one individual 
                (a leader or figurehead). This could be an individual who is supposed to work within the system but somehow not be a 
                part of the system. No matter how incredibly progressive and thoughtful a person might be, they cannot keep all of the 
                demands of such a patchwork of groups in mind when trying to push forward a campaign or policy. A group will inevitably 
                feel slighted or ignored. This is essentially the tension present during Bernie Sander’s catastrophic presidential run 
                in 2016.
            </p>

                This tension between class and identity is not unique to Marxism or Democratic Socialism. Indeed we can see it appear 
                in the variety of Anarchist groups with adjectives. I suspect it’s a tension that has existed since the dawn of 
                politics.

                What is to be done? I think something like communalism/confederalism/municipalism have the raw materials we can borrow 
                or emulate so that we can come closer to meeting everyone’s needs. The municipalities are autonomous or semi-autnomous 
                and make decisions that impact their locality. Additional, steps can be taken to help mitigate leaving a group out of 
                the discussion. For example, the Democratic Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (commonly known in the 
                West as Rojava) has a man and a woman as equal delegates or representatives for their village, region, etc. They do not 
                make decisions for their municipality or village when there is larger regional discussion but, instead express the 
                interest of their group and bring back information for further decisions to be made. While this might sound potentially 
                inefficient, I would like to point out the only time the US government is ever efficient in their decision making is 
                because there’s money to be made by themselves or their capitalist overlords.
            </p>
            <p>
                There’s a whole body of literature related to the communalism/confederalism/municipalism impulse. I don’t want to 
                recreate the wheel. I hope you can see the possibilities for something inclusive, egalitarian, and possibly 
                sustainable as long as the citizens of the confederation avoid the want for kings.
            </p>
